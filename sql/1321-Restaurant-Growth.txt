# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT distinct
    c.visited_on,
    (
        SELECT SUM(c2.amount)
        FROM Customer AS c2
        WHERE c2.visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
    ) AS amount,
    ROUND(
        (
            SELECT SUM(c2.amount) / 7
            FROM Customer AS c2
            WHERE c2.visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on

    ) AS average_amount
FROM Customer AS c
WHERE c.visited_on >= (
    SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(c2.visited_on), INTERVAL 6 DAY)
    FROM Customer AS c2
)
ORDER BY c.visited_on;



-- select distinct visited_on,
-- sum(amount) over w as amount,
-- round((sum(amount) over w)/7, 2) as average_amount
-- from Customer
-- window w as (
--     order by visited_on
--     range between interval 6 day preceding and current row
-- )
-- limit 6, 18446744073709551615;
