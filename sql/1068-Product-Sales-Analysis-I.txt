# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT product_name, year, price
FROM Sales
-- LEFT JOIN Product (Runtime 2271 ms)
INNER JOIN Product #(Runtime 1772 ms)
ON Sales.product_id = Product.product_id

# Left join causes looping while inner join uses hash maps , helping in significant runtime reductions
