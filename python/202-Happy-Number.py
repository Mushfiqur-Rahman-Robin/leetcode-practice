# time complexity: O(logn)
# space complexity: O(logn)
# check note

# For optimal space complexity, we can use Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare cycle detection algorithm, which reduces space complexity to O(1) without needing to store all previous numbers. This would not improve time complexity but could significantly optimize space usage.
