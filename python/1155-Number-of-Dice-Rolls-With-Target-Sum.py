class Solution:
    def numRollsToTarget(self, n: int, k: int, target: int) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7  
        ans = 0 
        l = 0  # Initialize the variable for the number of dice used.

        # Loop until the sum of the face-up numbers is less than or equal to (target - n).
        while l * k <= (target - n):
            res = (target - n) - (l * k)  # Calculate the remaining target after considering the number of dice used.

            # Update the answer using the formula for combinations.
            ans = (ans + ((-1)**l) * comb(n, l) * comb(res + n - 1, n - 1)) % mod

            l += 1 

        return ans
        

# Note: 

Let's go through the code step by step for the given Example 1:


mod = 10**9 + 7
ans = 0
l = 0

while l * k <= (target - n):
    res = (target - n) - (l * k)
    ans = (ans + ((-1)**l) * comb(n, l) * comb(res + n - 1, n - 1)) % mod
    l += 1

return ans

Example 1:
Input:

n = 1
k = 6
target = 3
Explanation:

We have one die with 6 faces.
The target sum is 3.
Code Execution:

Initialize mod as 10^9 + 7, ans as 0, and l as 0.
Enter the while loop condition: 0 * 6 <= (3 - 1), so it evaluates to True.
Calculate res as (3 - 1) - (0 * 6), which is 2.
Update ans using the formula:

ans = (ans + ((-1)**l) * comb(n, l) * comb(res + n - 1, n - 1)) % mod
Here, comb represents the combination function (n choose k).
comb(n, l) calculates the number of ways to choose l from n (1 choose 0 = 1).
comb(res + n - 1, n - 1) calculates the number of ways to choose n - 1 from res + n - 1.
(-1)**l alternates the sign.
Increment l by 1.
The loop condition is now 1 * 6 <= (3 - 1), which evaluates to False, so exit the loop.
Final Result:

The code returns ans, which is 1. This means there is one way to achieve the target sum of 3 with one die.

also do this explanation for example 2 and 3

Let's go through the code for Example 2 and Example 3:

Example 2:

mod = 10**9 + 7
ans = 0
l = 0

while l * k <= (target - n):
    res = (target - n) - (l * k)
    ans = (ans + ((-1)**l) * comb(n, l) * comb(res + n - 1, n - 1)) % mod
    l += 1

return ans

Input:

n = 2
k = 6
target = 7
Explanation:

We have two dice, each with 6 faces.
The target sum is 7.

Code Execution:

Initialize mod as 10^9 + 7, ans as 0, and l as 0.
Enter the while loop condition: 0 * 6 <= (7 - 2), so it evaluates to True.
Calculate res as (7 - 2) - (0 * 6), which is 5.
Update ans using the formula.
Increment l by 1.
Loop condition becomes 1 * 6 <= (7 - 2), which is True.
Calculate res as (7 - 2) - (1 * 6), which is -1.
Update ans using the formula.
Increment l by 1.
Loop condition becomes 2 * 6 <= (7 - 2), which is False, so exit the loop.
Final Result:

The code returns ans, which is 6. This means there are 6 ways to achieve the target sum of 7 with two dice.
Example 3:

mod = 10**9 + 7
ans = 0
l = 0

while l * k <= (target - n):
    res = (target - n) - (l * k)
    ans = (ans + ((-1)**l) * comb(n, l) * comb(res + n - 1, n - 1)) % mod
    l += 1

return ans
Input:

n = 30
k = 30
target = 500
Explanation:

We have thirty dice, each with thirty faces.
The target sum is 500.

Code Execution:

Initialize mod as 10^9 + 7, ans as 0, and l as 0.
Enter the while loop condition: 0 * 30 <= (500 - 30), so it evaluates to True.
Calculate res as (500 - 30) - (0 * 30), which is 470.
Update ans using the formula.
Increment l by 1.
Loop condition becomes 1 * 30 <= (500 - 30), which is True.
Calculate res as (500 - 30) - (1 * 30), which is 440.
Update ans using the formula.
Increment l by 1.
Continue this process until 29 * 30 <= (500 - 30), then exit the loop.
Final Result:

The code returns ans, which is 222616187. This means there are 222616187 ways to achieve the target sum of 500 with thirty dice.
